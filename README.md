# american-flag
Fun little project to practice HTML by creating an American flag from nothing but divs.

Flag is as close to the standard described in Executive Order 10834 as is possible with my current skill level with HTML/CSS.

Works fine most of the time. There are some alignment issues at some resolutions.
